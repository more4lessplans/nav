						<p>You are not be able to transfer your existing number in to use with our plan. If you need to keep your existing phone number this is achievable using a dual SIM device and a secondary line. A similar experience can be achieved by simply using a VOIP app to receive calls and texts on your existing number. This plan runs entirely on the Rogers network. The network is unaltered from it's original state. You will have access identical to Rogers customers. This plan is meant for mobile phones. Please make sure your device is compatible with the Rogers network and supports the proper LTE bands that Rogers uses. We do not recommend this plan for hubs and routers. That being said, we allow you as the customer to purchase with the intentions to use it with a mobile hub or router. Some routers and hubs can take full advantage of the unlimited data plan but we cannot offer any guarantees or refunds. The processing fee is non-refundable. Any claim you make will be thrown out. We are not responsible for any errors you make attempting to follow the instructions. Please only submit your information once. It is your responsibility to provide accurate information, any errors can cause delays for your plan to be set up, loss of a preferred number, or account cancellation. If the setup fees are not paid, your account is subject to cancellation, thus losing your phone number. Your submitted information remains private. No information is kept, other than your contact information you provided. We are not responsible if your device is not compatible with the network. Please ensure your device is unlocked or eligible to use with the proper network. Please sort out any fees that may be charged to you if you are ending a contract prematurely with another carrier. The advertised price excludes tax and additional add ons. The advertised price is our standard recommended price. We are not responsible for any additional costs due to a more costly plan option being selected. This plan costs $69 a month plus tax. The processing fee does not include your first month of service.
