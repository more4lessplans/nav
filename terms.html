We may bill you for a charge up to 6 months from the date the charge was incurred. We will apply a discount, promotion or benefit to your account as long as you remain eligible for it. We may check your eligibility from time to time, and if you become ineligible to receive that discount, promotion or benefit for any reason, we may remove it, and/or transfer your Service to a comparable Service plan, without prior notice.Equipment and related software may have to meet certain minimum requirements and be maintained in certain ways and in certain locations in order to access the Services or for the proper operation of the Services (e.g., 9-1-1 services). Those requirements may change from time to time without notice and you are responsible for updating or maintaining your Equipment and software as necessary to meet those requirements. We may provide software updates for the Equipment for the continued operation of the Services or the Equipment. Likewise, from time to time we may have to modify or remove previous software features in order to introduce new features to ensure that the Equipment remains compatible with technological advancements. If your Equipment or software is not up to date, we may not be able to provide you with applicable customer support.
